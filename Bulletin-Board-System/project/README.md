# MakersBBS Seed

A starter template to get you up and running with the MakersBBS COBOL project.
It is based on the [GnuCOBOL starter](https://github.com/makersacademy/gnucobol-starter)
and includes a few bits and pieces to get you going.

Tested on Mac only.

## Quickstart

Install the prerequisites:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [GNUCobol](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/)

```bash
; ./cbl setup
; ./cbl run
```

## Usage

```bash
; ./cbl help
Cobol Runner v0.1

Usage:

  * ./cbl test  # to run unit & environment comparison tests
  * ./cbl run   # to run main-program.cbl
  * ./cbl setup # to set up this project
  * ./cbl help  # show this message
```

## Environment Comparison Tests

The `env/` directory is to facilitate running your COBOL tests in a controlled
directory and then asserting on the contents of that directory afterwards.

You might use this to test a program in which you read from and then wrote to 
some files.

To see this in action, change the contents of 
`env/test/expected/WHAT_IS_THIS.md` and then run `./cbl test` to see the
failure.

There is also a `main` env, in which your `main-program` will be run. You
can store necessary data files in there.

## The Rules

* Tests go in `test/`.
* Code goes in `src/`.
* Name your files the same as the `PROGRAM-ID`. So if your `PROGRAM-ID` is
  "wonderful-nice-thing" then your file should be called
  "wonderful-nice-thing.cbl".
* Same with the test files. I suggest "test-wonderful-nice-thing.cbl".

Break any of these rules and the scripts might also break.
